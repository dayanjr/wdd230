            <p>The repetition principle in website design is when we have the repetition of some elements in the web page, and this principle is good to make the webpage easy to identify, on the website Obermayer.com we see that because of this principle the webpage is easily identifiable.</p>

            <h1 class="bruh">rule of thirds</h1>

            <img src="scripts/Screenshot(193).png" alt="screenshot of a webpage">
            <p>The rule of thirds in website design is when we have a structure commonly used for forms inside of the webpage that organize the form to better fit in the page, with this principle a website can have a better-looking form and save space, just like we see in the site dominos.com.</p>

            <h1 class="bruh">contrast</h1>

            <img src="scripts/Screenshot(194).png" alt="screenshot of a webpage">
            <p>The contrast principle in website design is when we have a webpage that displays different background colors to make that section stand out from the rest of the page. This is a good principle to be used for having a more appealing look on the website as we see on the site elementor.com</p>
